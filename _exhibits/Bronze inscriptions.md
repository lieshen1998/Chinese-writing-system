Bronze inscriptions are one of earliest Chinese writing scripts, preceded by the oracle bone inscriptions. Bronze inscriptions refer to inscriptions that appeared on ritual bronzes from the Shang dynasty (2nd millennium BC) to the Zhou dynasty (11th-3rd century BC). In ancient times, Chinese people used inscribed vessels for sacrificial feasts to honor and appease ancestral spirits. The Shang dynasty was in the initial stages of Bronze inscriptions, although bronze vessels were already present during this period, there were not many of them with bronze inscriptions until the Zhou dynasty. Early bronze inscriptions were always cast with a stylus in the wet clay of the bronze piece-mold and then cast the bronze. However, later inscriptions were usually engraved after the bronze was cast.Â <br>

The bronze inscriptions retain some writing styles of the oracle bones scripts, while further reducing the number of strokes and standardizing the writing style. Unlike the oracle bone inscriptions, which are characterized by thin and straight strokes, the bronze inscriptions are wide and thick, with many curved strokes and clusters. The inscriptions on the bronze vessels, with varying numbers of characters, are richer in content than the oracle bone pieces. They reflect the social life of the time, mostly celebrating the achievements of ancestors, emperors and nobility, as well as recording significant historical events. At current, a total of 372 characters have been found, and 2,420 can be identified.<br>
