The script was first created in the Qin Dynasty, was dominated in the Han Dynasty and continued to be used through the Wei-Jin periods. It was developed from the Seal Script. Seal script, with its complex structure and strokes, is not suitable for composing long documents or for writing at speed. The circular and balanced stroke form of the Seal Script was replaced by a standardized, angular stroke form in the clerical script. Thus the clerical script, as a writing system that did not require much time and effort to balance curves and symmetries, developed rapidly. The character of the clerical script tends to be wide and flat, with long horizontal strokes and short vertical strokes. Most notable characteristic of clerical script is the dramatically flared tail of one dominant horizontal or downward-diagonal stroke, especially that to the lower right. Because of this distinctive shape, the strokes are called 'silkworm head and wild goose tail'. Due to its high legibility for modern East Asian person, it is still used today in situations where decorative text is required, such as headlines, signage and advertisements.<br>
