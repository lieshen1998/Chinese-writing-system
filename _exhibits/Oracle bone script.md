The oracle bone script is the earliest known form of Chinese writing. It refers mainly to the writing carved on turtle plastrons or animal bones used in pyromantic divination by the royal family of the late Shang dynasty (the late 2nd millennium BC) in China. The emperors of the Shang dynasty used oracle bones for divination to predict the fortune of events, and then carved the information about the divination (such as the time and content of the divination, the diviner, the result of the divination, and the verification of the result of the divination) on the oracle bones, These oracle bones were kept as archival material by the royal historians.<br>
<br>
Oracle bone script was first discovered at the Yinxu site located in Xiaotun village, Anyang city, Henan province, China. More than 150,000 oracle bone pieces and 4,500 individual characters have been excavated. Oracle bone script has a symmetrical and stable structure. Despite its pictorial nature, oracle bone script has developed into a more systematic and fully functional script in terms of the number and structure of scripts. These oracle bone pieces are also extremely rich in content, covering many aspects of social situations in Shang dynasty. It generally deals with a wide range of topics between 10 and 100 characters, including astronomy, war, agriculture, religion, births and deaths in the royal family, etc.<br>
