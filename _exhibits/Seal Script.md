Introduction:

Seal script was common throughout the latter half of the 1st millennium BC. It developed from the bronze inscriptions in the Zhou Dynasty. Seal script is mainly divided into two types of script: the Large Seal Script and the Small Seal Script. The concept of the Large Seal Script is ambiguous and can cover a wide range of scripts (including a variation of Qin writing earlier than the small seal characters, the earlier Western Zhou forms, or even oracle bone characters as well), while after the unification of China by the first emperor of Qin dynasty - Qin Shi Huangdi, the Qin variant of seal script, known as the Small Seal Script, eventually became the standard and was adopted as the official script of China. Therefore, in the absence of any other clarifying terminology, the term ‘seal script’ refers to the Small Seal Script. 

The strokes of the Small Seal Script are horizontal and vertical, uniform in thickness. The strokes also have smooth turning. The character as a whole has a rectangular symmetrical structure with a tight top and a loose bottom. Due to its intricate strokes and smooth, graceful shape, it has high artistic value. The Small Seal Script was still widely used for decorative carvings and seals until the Han Dynasty (202 BC – 220 AD). When the Chinese writing systems reached the stage of the Small Seal Script, the outline of the script and the structure of the strokes gradually began to take shape. The pictorial nature of the Small Seal Script weakened, making characters more symbolic and less confusing to write and read. The use of the Small Seal Script in the Qin dynasty unified the national script and essentially eliminated the phenomenon of different scripts in different parts of the country, playing an important role in the history of Chinese writing.
